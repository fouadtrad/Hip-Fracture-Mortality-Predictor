## üè• Hip Fracture Pre-operative Mortality Prediction

This is a machine learning-based pre-operative risk calculator designed to predict **30-day mortality** in patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture. 

It is intended for **educational and research purposes only** and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical judgment.

üî¨ Built using data from NSQIP and developed with explainable AI techniques.
